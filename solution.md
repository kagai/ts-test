## Solution 

### Assumptions 
- We did not breake the function into any smaller functions as they were very few lines of code and were readable.
- No chnages to the test file were made. 



### Packages Added.
-  Prettier and Eslint were added for consistent code formatting.

### Thoughts thata were not implemented and why.
- I was thinking of adding rxjs and use forkjoin or combineLatest method , but that would be overkill in this case and would add a dependency that is not super necessary.
- Adding more unit test , i dint want to chnege this file due to the instructions given.


### Future improvements 
- Adding more unit test.
- use a docker container to run the application to ensure it runs on all environments the same.
- instead of promises use observables - offers more control on the returned values.
